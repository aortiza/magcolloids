Introduction
=============

The confined-colloids package is a set of routines made around LAMMPS to facilitate the simulation and analysis of the dynamics of colloids confined to a box. The current version of the package contains many routines for visualization of colloids confined to boxes of small height. An example of the phenomena that arises in this type of confinement can be found in `Osterman 2007 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.248301>`_. It uses a modified version of LAMMPS that includes two additions: Brownian Dynamics (obtained from `<https://github.com/anyuzx/Lammps_brownian>`_ ) and a paramagnet atom type.
